              Two years into our marriage, we felt like something was missing in our lives. We weren't ready to have kids, but our marriage
              felt incomplete. On a whim, we took a trip to a <strong>PetAdopt</strong> adoption event and met Charlie. When we first met him,
              he came running up to us with his tail wagging and so much energy that we knew immediately he was the one!
            </p>
            <p>
              Six months later and we don't know how we ever lived without him in our lives. He is waiting for us when we get home each
              day and ready to play. Sometimes life gets hard but it's easy to leave those troubles behind when we step into our house and
              are greeted by this carefree and loving bundle of fur!
            </p>
            <p>
              We needed him as much as he needed us. We were told that he had been found wandering around the river on a rainy night and shivering.
              Now he sits in front of the window sunning himself on warm days just waiting on us to get home. 
            </p>
            <p>
              We are so glad we visited <strong>PetAdopt</strong> on a whim and found the piece that made our small family complete. Well,
              at least until this fall when he gets a baby brother to protect!

              After a long career in the military, retirement seemed boring in comparison. My doctor said I would do well to get an animal to liven things
              up a little bit. Little did I know how right he was!
            </p>
            <p>
              It's been a little over a year since I picked Russ up from <strong>PetAdopt</strong> and he is by my side every chance he gets. He's a little
              on the senior side of life like me, but we still take trips to the park to throw the frisbee around or just walk. He's the best friend I didn't
              know I needed until he arrived. Now I can't imagine life without him.           
            </p>
            <p>
              Russ is a little on the older side, like me. After living a long and eventful life in the military, it's hard to settle down. Knowing that he's by my side 
              through everything makes it a little easier to cope with the change. I'm glad I took that trip to <strong>PetAdopt</strong> to find my best friend, Russ.

              After the loss of my eldest child, I was absolutely heartbroken. It's something I will never get over. There was a void in my
              heart that just felt like an empty hole and hurt. After some time had passed, I realized that my home felt quiet and empty. I
              decided that I needed a furry friend to bring some joy back into my home.
            </p>
            <p>
              After deciding I wanted to adopt a pet, I visited <strong>PetAdopt</strong>. The people were so friendly and helped me along every step
              of my journey. When I arrived, there were dogs running around playing and looking so happy. When I met Duke, I immediately felt the love and
              knew he was the one. He was a little older, which was perfect since he would be past the stage of eating my furniture, but he was still 
              energetic and friendly. 
            </p>
            <p>
              After bringing Duke home that day, I have found myself laughing and enjoying life again. We have a loving relationship and I look
              forward to waking up next to my best friend every morning! His presence has helped heal the heartache that I felt when I lost my child.
              For that I am forever grateful. I can finally move into the next chapter of my life.

              I had just went through a divorce and my wife got our dog. It made me sad and I felt like there was a void in my life since I had just
              lost my wife and my dog all at the same time. So I went down to <strong>PetAdopt</strong> and found a friend to fill the void. 
              Charley had been returned from his previous family because he did not get along with their dogs. He is very territorial, but he is
              friendly with me and all my friends. He gets very excited every time he meets a new person, jumping up and down and hoping they will
              play with him. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Charley is a pit bull mix, but he loves me and gets excited every time I walk in the door of the house. He does tricks for turkey-bacon treats and pig-ears. 
              I also got him a ball launcher. He loves it when I shoot the ball for him. We also rough-house from time to time. He loves it when I take him
              for rides in my car. We even went with me to see the Christmas lights in the park last year. He hung his head out the window like he was trying
              to smell everything in the world all at once. He had a great time.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm not sure if I needed him more or if he needed me more. Either way, I'm glad I made the trip to <strong>PetAdopt</strong> to take
              him home with me. I couldn't imagine life without him in it now, and he helped me get through a tough time in my life. I'm forever
              grateful to him for that!

              I was not a cat person, or a dog person, or an animal person in general. That's what I thought, but it happened that I went with
              a friend of mine to <strong>PetAdopt</strong> because she was looking for a pet a little kitten won my heart. While my
              friend was deciding on which cat to get, little Bella began to rub against my ankle and purr. It warmed my heart and I knew my
              days of not being a pet person were over. 
            </p>
            <p>
              It turns out Bella was picked up by a couple who nearly ran her over while she was wandering around in the middle of the road. They
              pulled over to pick her up, but she was terrified. They said she peed on the man who picked her up because she was so scared. When
              they brought her to <strong>PetAdopt</strong> she was shy and didn't play with the other kittens.
            </p>
            <p>
              The staff were all surprised when she warmed up to me. They said she had not taken a liking to any animals or staff until that moment.
              It was like she was waiting for me and nobody else. Ever since that day, life has been so much more fun around the house. She
              absolutely loves her tuna, and putting her butt right in my face and then sitting on my laptop while I'm trying to study for school.
              Truthfully, I wouldn't have it any other way. My life is so much better with her in it, and I didn't even know what I was missing until
              she chose me.

              I saw a picture of a golden doodle named Chloe on the <strong>PetAdopt</strong> website and knew from that moment she was the dog for me. I asked my mom if we
              could get her and she said we could meet her and see. The next week my sister, brother, and I were scheduled for a meet-and-greet with Chloe and we all loved
              her energetic and loving nature. We took her home that day and she has been an integral part of our daily lives ever since.
            </p>
            <p>
              We all love having Chloe in our lives. She loves going with me on my morning run, watching my brother play video games, and playing fetch with my little sister. 
              She also likes taking naps on the couch right next to the window where the sun shines through, playing with the most annoying squeaky toys that my little 
              brother gets for her, and just being around the three of us and mom. It has been five years now, and we simply cannot imagine life without her in it. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The three of us try our best to "pay-it-forward" by volunteering at <strong>PetAdopt</strong> when we have time. We hope to help others experience the joy that
              we have found in sharing our lives with Chloe. We hope to help as many animals as possible find a family in need of some unconditional furry love.
